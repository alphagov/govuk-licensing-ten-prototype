          <p>Late notices can be given no later than 5 working days but no earlier than 9 working days before the event in relation to which the notice is given.  A late notice given later than 5 working days before the event to which it relates will be returned as void and the activities described in it will not be authorised.</p>
          <p>The number of late notices that can be given in any one calendar year is limited to 10 for personal licence holders and 2 for non-personal licence holders.  These count towards the total number of temporary event notices (i.e. 50 temporary event notices per year for personal licence holders and 5 temporary event notices for non-personal licence holders).</p>
          <p>If there is an objection from either the police or local authority exercising environmental health functions, the event will not go ahead and a counter notice will be issued.</p>
        </div>
      </details>

      <p>The event youâ€™re holding is less than 10 working days in the future. You can submit a late temporary event notice.</p>
